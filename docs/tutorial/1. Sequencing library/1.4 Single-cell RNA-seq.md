`tresor.sc.library` is the module that can simulate sequencing libraries at the single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) level. This is used to simulate reads that are tagged by genes expressed in cells, respectively.

# Usage

=== "Python"

    ``` py hl_lines="2-5 20"
    ts.sc.library(
        r_root='D:/Programming/R/R-4.3.2/',
        num_genes=6,
        num_cells=2,
        simulator='spsimseq',

        seq_num=50,
        len_params={
            'umi': {
                'umi_unit_pattern': 3,
                'umi_unit_len': 12,
            },
            'seq': 100,
        },
        seq_params={
            'custom': 'BAGC',
            'custom_1': 'V',
        },
        material_params={
            'bc_lib_fpn': to('data/3M-february-2018.txt'),  # None
            'fasta_cdna_fpn': to('data/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz'),  # None False
        },
        is_seed=True,

        working_dir=to('data/simu/docs/'),

        condis=['umi', 'custom', 'seq', 'custom_1'],

        sim_thres=3,
        permutation=0,

        mode='short_read',  # long_read short_read

        verbose=False,
    )
    
    ```

=== "Shell"

    ``` c++ linenums="1"
    tresor library_sc \
    -cfpn ./tresor/data/libgene.yml \
    -snum 50 \
    -rfpn D:/Programming/R/R-4.3.2/ \
    -ncell 2 \
    -ngene 20 \
    -gsimulator spsimseq \
    -permut 0 \
    -sthres 3 \
    -wd ./tresor/data/simu/ \
    -md short_read \
    -is True \
    -vb True
    ```

Code highlighted is executed as equivalent to do coding in the following way. We employed the SPsimSeq tool[^1] to simulate scRNA-seq data. In this case, we simulated a cell-by-gene count matrix containing 6 genes and 2 cells.

``` py linenums="1"
import tresor as ts

gmat = ts.gmat.spsimseq_sc(
    R_root='D:/Programming/R/R-4.3.2/',
    num_genes=6,
    num_cells=2,
)

print(gmat)
```

The count matrix is formed below.
``` py linenums="1"

Cell_1    50.0     0.0     0.0    14.0   223.0
```

Then, we use this count matrix as input to Tresor's corresponding module `ts.sc.library`.

## Understanding files
The resultant files of the simulated sequencing library are shown in the following picture.

!!! info "Annotation"

    We take the expression count of 15 (cell 0 and gene 4) as an example.

    * ***seq_c_0_g_4.txt*** - sequences for cell 0 and gene 4
    * ***umi_c_0_g_4.txt*** - UMIs for cell 0 and gene 4
    * ***barcode.txt*** - barcodes
    * ***cdna_ids_alone_c_0_g_4.txt*** - cDNA IDs for cell 0 and gene 4

In this case, we used homotrimer blocks to simulate UMIs where the length of each UMI is set to be 36 containing 12 trimer blocks.

Because of a barcode library provided, Tresor seeks barcodes from it.
<figure markdown="span">
  ![Image title](../../img/slib/sc/barcode.jpg){ width="800" }
  <figcaption><strong>Fig</strong> 3. Simulated barcodes</figcaption>
</figure>

The sequences are randomly chosen from the input human cDNAs and truncated according to the length of each short read.

The sequencing library is tabulated to a dataframe. Each row shows the necessary information about the read 1

1. Sequence
2. Identifier
3. Source

!!! note "Attention"

    The identifier is composed of ID of the molecule, character `c` for cell, ID of the cell, character `g` for gene, and ID of the gene, demarked by *.

Init means a read 1 is a sequence from the sequencing library, to differ from those from PCR amplification.

For cell 0, the chosen gene symbols of gene 4 are recorded, which correspond to the taken truncated sequences by order.
