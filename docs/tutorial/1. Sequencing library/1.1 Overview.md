We developed a wide array of functionalities for library preparation and generation to better meet the needs of data simulation across different sequencing technologies and experimental conditions. To facilitate the simulation of both long and short reads, we provided two distinct modules: one for extracting sequences from a reference genome and another for randomly synthesising sequences. The reference genome, which can be from any species, must be organized in the Fasta format. On the other hand, randomly synthesizing sequences involves sampling nucleotides from a uniform distribution.

* `tresor.locus` - a module that can simulate sequencing libraries at a given genome locus.
* `tresor.gene` - a module that can simulate sequencing libraries at the bulk RNA sequencing level.
* `tresor.sc` - a module that can simulate sequencing libraries at the single-cell RNA sequencing level.
