In one PCR cycle, a gross of DNA is amplified. These steps are repeated for 20-40 cycles, resulting in exponential amplification of the target DNA sequence. Single-cell sequencing involves analyzing the genome or transcriptome of individual cells. This process requires deeper PCR cycles (i.e., more cycles) for several reasons such as limited starting material and poor coverage. This also comes with challenges, such as an increased risk of amplification biases and errors.

    Changing PCR cycles on demand can help us understand how errors in genetic material are amplified and what the error profile looks like. This can further help to optimise relevant sequencing biotech.
