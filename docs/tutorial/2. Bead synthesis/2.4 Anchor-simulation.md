To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of **anchor-based** UMI identification versus a **positional-based** method under varying error rates (from \(10^{-5}\) to 0.1), in the presence of:

- PCR errors
- Sequencing errors
- Insertion/deletion errors

Please see [this tutorial](https://2003100127.github.io/mcverse/anchor) :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square: for the Tresor application with UMIche.

### 1. Efficiency metric for UMI identification

To assess how well UMIs can be discovered under either strategy, we define:

$$
P = \frac{n}{N}
$$

where:

- \(N = 5000\): Total number of subsampled reads
- \(n\): Number of reads whose UMIs were successfully identified

This is used to compare the performance between:

- Positional strategy (based on fixed offsets in primer sequence)
- Anchor strategy (using inserted sequences such as BAGC and a terminal base _V_)

---

### 2. Robustness against indel errors

To assess how well UMIs can be extracted in the presence of **indels**, we define:

$$
Q = \frac{m}{N}
$$

Where:

- \(m\): Number of reads with successfully identified UMIs under anchor design
- \(N\): Total number of simulated reads
- The denominator remains the same as in \(P\), allowing for fair comparison

This metric isolates the impact of indel tolerance, contrasting anchor-based extraction vs. methods without anchor (assuming indel-free reads).

### 3. Logistic fit function for captured read quantity

A logistic function is fitted to characterise how performance (i.e., estimated numbers of captured reads) degrades as error rate increases:

$$
l(x) = \frac{a}{1 + e^{-b(x - c)}} + \varepsilon
$$

Where:

- \(x\): P and Q
- \(a, b, c\): Parameters to fit

This model helps quantify robustness of each method to increasing error rates.

Both simulations used a wide range of error rates:

\[
10^{-5},\ 2.5 \times 10^{-5},\ 5 \times 10^{-5},\ 7.5 \times 10^{-5},\ 0.0001,\ 0.00025,\ 0.0005,\ 0.00075,\ 0.001,\ 0.0025,\ 0.005,\ 0.0075,\ 0.01,\ 0.025,\ 0.05,\ 0.075,\ 0.1
\]

---

These allow for comprehensive simulation-based benchmarking of UMI extraction robustness under real-world sequencing noise conditions.
